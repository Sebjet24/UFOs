# UFOs

## Project Overview
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, I’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
I created a dynamic webpage by allowing visitors to simultaneously filter UFO reports based on different criteria. Date, city, state, nation, and shape were among the table filters. Every sighting would be gathered into one neat bundle and made available to Dana (and her readers). Although the table is well-organized, it is enormous, with hundreds of rows, making it impossible for one person to go through and learn. As a result, the filter option is available for group or individual searches, allowing the user to examine, for example, all data linked to May 1st in the United States, as seen below:

Furthermore, the table may be filtered collectively on all criteria, with the result shown in the table based on the supplied inputs as shown below.

## Summary
The majority of the websites we use these days are dynamic. These dynamic websites employ databases to dynamically build webpage content on the server, which is then transmitted to the user's browser. The benefit is that each user receives personalised material that is unique to them and differs from what is offered to other users. A static website, on the other hand, is often built entirely of static material (mainly utilizing only HTML & CSS) that is already saved on the server as full files. As a result, every user that requests a specific webpage from this server will receive the identical content. 

Furthermore, compared to a dynamic website, the cost of hosting a static website is nothing because it only requires a simple web enabled file server.
You may absolutely go with a static website if you only want a simple blog kind of website to manage at a low cost. Dynamic websites, on the other hand, are the way to go if you want to construct a website with thousands of web pages or contents that can be changed for each user. As a result, the cost of developing dynamic webpages is far more than the cost of developing a static website.

One of the downsides of the dynamic webpage that was produced is as follows:

In reality, using a dynamic homepage with a filtered table with different alternatives for each entry has resulted in a congested and cluttered page. Instead, we may design a dropdown menu that allows us to choose all of the alternatives with a single click. 

We can make the dynamic webpage more user-friendly, thus here are some suggestions for developing the dynamic webpage:

First- With an ever-increasing number of people accessing the internet via mobile devices, it is now a must for a webpage to be mobile-optimized and responsive, as well as all of the content we publish. There are two major factors to consider. On mobile devices, non-mobile-optimized content will load slowly, reducing our chances of conversion. The second is about participation. Having mobile-optimized content necessitates offering touch-friendly experiences.

Second- The data table has seven columns and virtually covers the entire dynamic site. The following items can be added to the table to make it more efficient:

- A toolbar with a dropdown menu in the upper right corner of the page, such as:

- In the left corner of the website, include a contact link for individuals who wish to contact us and acquire more information.
